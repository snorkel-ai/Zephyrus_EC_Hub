Please see below for high quality examples. Note that for examples 3-6, there are lines drawn on the image to help approximate values. Use a ruler or straight-edge to do the same.

Question
Which colorectal cancer cell line shows the largest absolute increase in VEGF protein concentration (ng/l) when treated with IL-17 compared to its PBS control?
Answer
Final Answer: LoVo
Why is this good?
* Requires identification of the panel of interest (panel B) without explicitly saying Panel B, need to check axes of multiple charts
* Requires identification of which bars correspond to PBS treatment vs. IL-17
* Requires multiple calculations - need to find absolute increase for each cell line

Question
Based on the convergence plots for minimizing Nesterov’s function, which algorithm variant first reduces the normalized error (f(x_k)–f(x) over f(x_0)–f(x)) down to 10^-4 using the fewest oracle calls?
Answer
RDD_NE with parameter NE=12000
Why is this good?
* Requires identification and comparison across numerous different algorithm curves
* Requires comparison across many different panels
* Requires extrapolation of values from unlabeled points

Question
What is the approximate value of the dispersion curve at the r value where there is the largest difference between velocity and PSF?
Answer
Approximately 70 km/s


Why is this good?
* Requires reading labels to identify curves (i.e. “Velocity” curve vs. saying “the red curve”)
* Requires several sequential steps of reasoning - not just reading a single value
   * Identify the Velocity and PSF curves
   * Find location of largest difference between
   * Find the corresponding r value
   * Identify the Dispersion curve
   * Get the Dispersion value at that r value

Question
At the time where the 2 curves in I_Diode intersect for the 3rd time, what is the approximate V_Diode value for PCB technology?
Answer
Approximately -90 V


Note: Use of word “approximately” here given difficulty in estimating exact value due to steep slope. Alternatively, could give a small range such as -85 to -95.
Why is this good?
* Requires identification of unlabeled intersection points as well as counting to identify the third one
* Requires approximation of an unlabeled value for the final answer
* Requires comparison of relationship between two different plots in one image
* Requires multiple sequential reasoning steps:
   * Identify I_Diode and V_Diode graphs
   * Find the Time value of the third intersection point in I_Diode
   * Identify the PCB curve in the V_Diode graph
   * Estimate the value of the PCB curve at the identified time value

Question
For the time series (red, green, blue, pink) in image A with the greatest drawdown in a 10 ns window, determine the percentage of reduction for that time series during that window.
Answer
Approximately 19% (approximate due to needing to estimate the 10ns window boundaries as well as the intermediate Y value at those boundaries)


Why is this good?
* Requires multiple sequential reasoning steps:
   * Identify the curve with the greatest drawdown in a 10 ns window
   * Identify the 10 ns window where that drawdown occurs
   * Estimate the unlabeled SASA values at the beginning and end of that time window
   * Perform a % reduction calculation based on those values
* Requires estimation of unlabeled points


Note: An alternative strong question could involve taking the 10 ns window identified in panel A and using it to get values from panel B - adds extra complexity by having to reason across multiple panels.

Question
Calculate the ratio of the fold-change in cytosolic cytochrome c release to the fold-change in apoptotic index when comparing SID Wt to Wt.
Answer
Approximately 1.6


Why is this good?
* Requires identification of the appropriate panels (A and C) without explicitly naming them
* Requires multiple sequential reasoning steps:
   * Identify panel A as the first panel of interest
   * Get values of the difference between SID Wt and Wt in A (approx. 240)
   * Identify panel B as the second panel of interest
   * Get values of the difference between SID Wt and Wt in B (approx. 150)
   * Use these values to calculate the ratio (240/150 = 1.6)
